# Railway-Reservation-System
A Railway Reservation system automates booking, cancellation , and management of passenger reservation for Trains.

Features of the Railway Reservation System (Based on the Provided C Program)
1. Seat Initialization

The system initializes all seats (1–10) as Available.

Each seat has:

Seat number

Booking status (0 = available, 1 = booked)

Passenger name

2. Display Seat Status

Shows every seat's current condition:

BOOKED seats with passenger name

Available seats

Displays a summary of total available seats.

Uniqueness of This Railway Reservation System
1. Minimalistic, Educational Design

The system is small and ideal for learning:

Arrays

Structs

Strings

Input validation

Menu-driven programs

2. Realistic Reservation Logic (Simplified)

Even though the system is small, it mimics real reservation behavior:

Booked vs Available state

Passenger name association

Confirmation for cancellations

Prevention of invalid operations (double-booking, canceling empty seat)
